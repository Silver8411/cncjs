; Tool change for all WCS G54-59
; This macro allows you to use a fixed machine location for a tool change/probe. Ideal when your workpiece surface has been carved away.
; This macro changes the tool with G43.1, so different offsets apply in all WCS
; When you have started this macro, the machine applies a dynamic tool offset with G43.1
; To disable G43.1, type G49 in the command, or the machine is shut down, the program is closed, or you manually stop G-code
; This macro is ideal for running tool changes that work in all WCS
; Make sure you are in the desired WCS before doing a tool change

; Wait until the planner queue is empty
